Task - 2 (Laplace Approximation)

1. Compile the code using : mpicc -o laplace Laplace-Approximation.c

2. Run the code as : time mpirun -n 1/2/4/8 ./laplace [options]

-n = To Change Matrix Size
-d = To change acceptance value ( 0.1 - 0.00001)
-w = To change Laplace relaxation factor (0.1 - 1.0)
-P = To change the matrix size
-I = To change the initialization Type (fast or rand)
-m = To change the maximum number in the matrix

For example: mpirun -n 4 ./laplace -n 16 -d 0.0001 -I fast -P 1 -w 0.5

Note: SIZE of matrix is assumed to be a multiple of number of nodes.
